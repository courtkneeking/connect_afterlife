   <h1>What is Connect Afterlife?</h1>
   <p>Pitch: 
      I'm currently building a website that that aims to make the process after the death of a friend or family member a little easier. It will be somewhat of a social network site combined with tools to help guide through the necessary steps of organizing a funeral, making an obituary and etc. 
      
      Design: 
      allow the users to pick their own color scheme for the page, ten options
